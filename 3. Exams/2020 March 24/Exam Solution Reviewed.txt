You misinterpreted what 1_{0,infinity}(x) is
You correctly identified the problem with but using the expectation will not solve it.
The values of alpha you take could work but could be tricky. There is a small interval
of them that will work directly. However, given your misinterpretation of 1_{0,infinity}(x)
it could be difficult for you to find an alpha.
